	<h2>Universal Serial Bus(USB)</h2>
	<p>A Universal Serial Bus (USB) is a common interface that enables communication between devices and a host controller such as a personal computer (PC). It connects peripheral devices such as digital cameras, mice, keyboards, printers, scanners, media devices, external hard drives and flash drives. Because of its wide variety of uses, including support for electrical power, the USB has replaced a wide range of interfaces like the parallel and serial port.</p>
	<p>A USB is intended to enhance plug-and-play and allow hot swapping. Plug-and-play enables the operating system (OS) to spontaneously configure and discover a new peripheral device without having to restart the computer. As well, hot swapping allows removal and replacement of a new peripheral without having to reboot.</p>

	<p>Although there are several types of USB connectors, the majority of USB cables are one of two types, type A and type B. The USB 2.0 standard is type A; it has a flat rectangle interface that inserts into a hub or USB host which transmits data and supplies power. A keyboard or mouse are common examples of a type A USB connector. A type B USB connector is square with slanted exterior corners. It is connected to an upstream port that uses a removable cable such as a printer. The type B connector also transmits data and supplies power. Some type B connectors do not have a data connection and are used only as a power connection.</p>
	<p>The USB was co-invented and established by Ajay Bhatt, a computer architect who had been working for Intel. In 1994 seven companies that included Intel, Compaq, Microsoft, IBM, Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), Nortel and NEC Corporation started the development of the USB. Their objective was to make it easier to connect peripheral devices to a PC and eliminate the mass amount of connectors. Factors involved included: creating larger bandwidths, streamlining software configurations and solving utilization problems for current interfaces.</p>
	<p>The USB design is standardized by the USB Implementers Forum (USBIF) that is comprised of a group of companies supporting and promoting the USB. The USBIF not only markets the USB but maintains the specifications and upholds the compliance program. Specifications for the USB were created in 2005 with the 2.0 version. The standards were introduced by the USBIF in 2001; these included the older versions of 0.9, 1.0 and 1.1, which are backward compatible.</p>
