	<section><b>Winchester Disk</b></section>
	<p>Winchester disk is an early removable disk drive from IBM that put the heads and platters (disks) in a sealed unit for greater speed. Before the Winchester architecture, removable disks were like removable disks today, in which the read/write heads remain in the drive and make contact with the platter after the cartridge is inserted.</p>

	<p> It was introduced in 1973 as the model 3340, the drive had one permanent and one removable spindle, each holding 30MB. The "30-30" storage capacities led to the Winchester nickname after the Winchester 30-30 rifle. The term later referred to all fixed hard disks because the heads and platters are always encased in the same, sealed unit. </p>

	<p>A Zip drive is a small, portable disk drive used primarily for backing up and archiving personal computer files. The trademarked Zip drive was developed and is sold by Iomega Corporation. Zip drives and disks come in two sizes. The 100 megabyte size actually holds 100,431,872 bytes of data or the equivalent of 70 floppy diskettes. There is also a 250 megabyte drive and disk. The Iomega Zip drive comes with a software utility that lets you copy the entire contents of your hard drive to one or more Zip disks.</p>

	<p>A Jaz drive is a small, portable hard disk drive used primarily for backing up and archiving personal computer files. The Jaz drive is sold by Iomega Corporation, the same company that developed the Zip drive. Both the Jaz drive and the disks come in two sizes, 1 GB and 2 GB. The two sizes look similar, but a 2 GB disk is not compatible with a 1 GB Jaz drive. The 2 GB Jaz drive can use both disk sizes. Internal and external Jaz drives are available. The Jaz drive uses the Small Computer System Interface (Small Computer System Interface) and requires a SCSI controller.</p>

	<p>Super disk is a storage technology developed by Imation Corporation that supports very high-density diskettes. SuperDisk diskettes are etched with a servo pattern at the factory. This pattern is then read by the SuperDisk drive to precisely align the read/write head. The result is that a SuperDisk diskette can have 2,490 tracks, as opposed to the 160 tracks that conventional 3.5-inch 1.44 MB diskettes use. This higher density translates into 120 MB capacity per diskette.</p>

	<p>A pen drive, or a USB flash drive, is a portable data-storage device. Pen drives have replaced the floppy drives of old and have become the most popular data-storage devices among consumers. Micro, lightweight and handy, a pen drive can be easily carried from place to place by students, professionals, academicians and independent tech consultants. Currently available pen drives with storage capacities ranging from 8GB and 32GB can be used to store graphics-heavy documents, photos, music files and video clips.</p>
