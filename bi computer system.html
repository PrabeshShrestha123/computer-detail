Component OF Computer
</section>
		A computer system is a combination of six element.They are:
		<ol>
			<li>Hardware</li>
			<p>Hardware refers to the part of the computer which we can touch. It is the physical devices of the computer. It consists of interconnected electronic equipment that controls everything the computer does. It includes input devices, input devices, output devices, processing devices and storage devices. Example of hardware are keyboard, monitor, CPU, hard disk and RAM.</p>
			<li>Software</li>
			<p>The software is the term used to describe the instruction that tells the hardware, what and how to perform a task. Without software, the hardware is useless. Examples of software are Window 7, MS office, Internet explorer, etc.</p>
			<li>Data/Information</li>
			<p>The function of a computer system is to convert data into information. Data can be considered as the raw facts whether in a paper, electronic or the other form that is processed by the computer. In other words , data consist of the raw facts and figures that are processed to form information. Information is summarized data or manipulated or processed data.</p>
			<li>procedure</li>
			<p>The procedure is a description of how things are done, step for accomplishing a result. Procedure for a computer system appears in documentation manual, also known as reference manual which contains instruction, rules, and guidelines to follow when using hardware and software. When you buy a microcomputer or software package, it comes with one or more documentation manuals.</p>
			<li>People</li>
			<p>People constitute the most important parts of the computer system. People operate the computer hardware and create the computer software. They also follow a certain procedure when using the hardware and software.</p>
			<li>Communiocation</li>
			<p>When one computer system is set up to share data and information electronically with another computer system, communication becomes a system element. In other words, the manner on which the various individual system are connected by wires, cables, phone lines, microwave, Wi-Fi or satellite is an element of the total computer system.</p>
