	<h2>Output Hardware</h2>
	<br>
	<p>An output hardware is any hardware used to send data from a computer to another device or user. Most computer data output that is meant for humans is in the form of audio or video. Thus, most output devices used by humans are in these categories. Examples include monitors, projectors, speakers, headphones and printers.</p>

	    <p>Output devices allow computers to communicate with users and with other devices. This can include peripherals, which may be used for input/output (I/O) purposes, like network interface cards (NICs), modems, IR ports, RFID systems and wireless networking devices, as well as mechanical output devices, like solenoids, motors and other electromechanical devices.</p><p>Some of the most common output devices that people are familiar with include monitors, which produce video output; speakers, which produce audio output; and printers, which produce text or graphical output.</p>
