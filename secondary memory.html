	<h2>Secondary Memory</h2>
	<p>It is also known as External memory/Storage memory/Auxiliary memory/Backup memory. It is used for storing data and instructions permanently. It is also used for carrying data from one computer to another. Secondary memory is not directly accessible to CPU. It is usually slower for read/write, cheaper and used in larger storage capacity.Example: Hard disk, CD, DVD, Pen drive, etc.</p>
	<p>Types of Secondary memory are:<br>
      1.Magnetic memory<br>
      2.Optical memory</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>Magnetic Memory</li>
      	<p>Magnetic memory uses the property of magnet for storing data. It is in use since first generations of computer. It contains data storing surface coated by magnetic oxide. Magnetic memory is further divided as:</p>
      	<ol>
      		<li>Magnetic Drum</li><br>
      		<div>
      			<img src=" magnetic drum.jpg" height="300" width="350"><br>
      			Fig:Magnetic Drum 
      		</div>
      		<p>Magnetic drum contains a metallic drum coated by magnetic oxide on the outer surface of the drum, data is stored in this surface. It was in use in first and second generations of computer.</p>
      		<li>Magnetic Tape</li><br>
      		<div>
      			<img src="magnetic tape.jpg" height="300" width="350"><br>
      			Fig: Magnetic Tape
      		</div>
      		<p>Magnetic tape contains thin plastic ribbon, only one side of the ribbon is used for storing data. The data storing side is coated by magnetic oxide. It is a sequential access memory. So, the data read/write speed is slower. It is mainly used for storing audio, video and back-up data. It is highly reliable. It requires magnetic tape drive for reading and writing data. It has the storage capacity of 100MB-200GB. The width of the ribbon also varies from 4mm-1inch.</p>
      		<li>Flash Memory</li><br>
      		<div>
      			<img src="flash memory.jpg"><br>
      				Fig :Flash Memory
      		</div>
      		<p>Flash memory is a type of electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM). Whew, that's a mouthful. The name comes from how the memory is designed -- a section of memory cells can be erased in a single action or in a "flash." A common use of flash memory is to store the BIOS settings in a computer's ROM. When the BIOS needs to be changed, the flash memory can be written in blocks, rather than bytes, making it easy to update. Most modems use flash memory for the same reason.</p>
      		<li>Magnetic Disk</li><br>
      		<div>
      			<img src="magnetic disk.jpg"><br>
      			Fig: Magnetic Disk
      		</div>
      		<p>Magnetic disk contains a circular disc made of metal or plastic. Both side of the disc is usually used for storing data. The disc is coated by magnetic oxide. The disc is divided into multiple concentric circles known as track. Tracks are further divided into small area known as sectors. Data are stored in sectors.Example: Hard disk, floppy disk, zip disk, super disk, Winchesterdisk, jaz disk.</p>
      		<ul>
      		<li>Hard Disk</li><br>
      		<div>
      			<img src="hard disk.jpg" height="300" width="350"><br>
      			Fig: Hard Disk
      		</div>
      		<p>It is used as main storage device of the computer. It uses 2-4 metallic disk (platter). The disk is usually made of aluminum. Both sides of the disk is used for storing data except the upper side of the uppermost disk and lower side of the lowermost disk. The data storing surface is coated by magnetic oxide. Each data storing surface contains separate read/write head. During data read/write process platter rotates at the rate of 3600-15000rpm. Hard disk is also known as hard drive because both data storing disk and data read/write components are combined together. It has the storage capacity of few mega bytes to tera byte.</p>
      		<li>Floppy Disk</li><br>
      		<div>
      			<img src="floppy disk.jpg" height="300" width="350"><br>
      			Fig: Floppy Disk
      		</div>
      		<p>It contains single plastic disk. Initially it was used as a main storage device but nowadays it is used for carrying data from one computer to another. It requires floppy drive for its operation. It is not reliable as hard disk because the data storing surface is exposed. So, it may be affected by dust particles and magnetic field.</p>
      	    </ul>
      	</ol>
      	<li>Optical memory</li>
      	<p>Optical memory uses light beam for its operation. It is developed in fourth generation of computer. It is mainly used for storing audio/video, backup as well as for carrying data. It requires optical drive for its operation. Its read/write speed is slower compared to hard disk and flash memories.Example: CD, DVD, BD</p>
      	<ol>
      		<li>CD</li><br>
      		<div>
      			<img src="cd.jpg" height="200" width="250"><br>
      			Fig: Compact Disk
      		</div>
      		<p>It stands for Compact Disk. It has storage capacity of 700 MB or approximately 90 minutes of standard audio. CD contains hard circular plastic, single side of this plastic is coated by aluminum alloy. This alloy stores data. It is protected by additional thin plastic covering. CD required CD drive for its operation. Types of CD are:</p>
      		<ul>
      			<li>CD-R</li>
      			<p>CD-R (Compact Disc Recordable) is a type of write once, read many (WORM) compact disc (CD) format that allows one-time recording on a disc. The CD-R (as well as the CD-RW) format was introduced by Philips and Sony in their 1988 specification document, the Orange Book. Prior to the release of the Orange Book, CDs had been read-only audio (CD-Digital Audio, described in the Red Book), to be played in CD players, and multimedia (CD-ROM), to be played in computers' CD-ROM drives. After the Orange Book, any user with a CD recorder drive could create their own CDs from their desktop computers.</p>
      			<li>CD-RW</li>
      			<p>CD-RW (Compact Disc Rewriteable) is a compact disc (CD) format that allows repeated recording on a disc. The CD-RW format was introduced by Hewlett-Packard, Mitsubishi, Philips, Ricoh, and Sony, in a 1997 supplement to Philips and Sony's Orange Book. CD-RW is Orange Book III (CD-MO was I, while CD-R was II). Prior to the release of the Orange Book, CDs had been read-only audio (CD-Digital Audio, described fully in the Red Book), to be played in CD players, and multimedia (CD-ROM), to be played in computers' CD-ROM drives. After the Orange Book, any user with a CD Recorder drive could create their own CDs from their desktop computers. CD-RW drives can write both CD-R and CD-RW discs and can read any type of CD.</p>
      			<li>CD-ROM</li>
      			<p>CD-ROM (Compact Disc, read-only-memory) is an adaptation of the CD that is designed to store computer data in the form of text and graphics, as well as hi-fi stereo sound. The original data format standard was defined by Philips and Sony in the 1983 Yellow Book. Other standards are used in conjunction with it to define directory and file structures, including ISO 9660, HFS (Hierarchal File System, for Macintosh computers), and Hybrid HFS-ISO. Format of the CD-ROM is the same as for audio CDs: a standard CD is 120 mm (4.75 inches) in diameter and 1.2 mm (0.05 inches) thick and is composed of a polycarbonate plastic substrate (underlayer - this is the main body of the disc), one or more thin reflective metal (usually aluminum) layers, and a lacquer coating.</p>

      			Fig: Digital Versatile Disk
      		</div>
      		<p>It stands for Digital Versatile Disk. It has the storage capacity of 4.7GB to 17GB. Its shape and size is similar to CD but the difference in storage capacity is due to different chemical component and data is compressed before storing. It requires DVD drive for its operation. Read/write speed of DVD is slower than that of CD. Types of DVD are:</p>
      		<ul>
      			<li>DVD-R</li>
      			<p>DVD-R stands for "Digital Versatile Disc Recordable." A DVD-R looks the same as a regular DVD, but like a CD-R, it can be used to record data. Once a DVD-R has been "burned," or written to, it cannot be written to again. A basic single-sided, single-layer DVD-R disc can store 4.7GB of data. Double-layer discs can store 8.5GB, while double-sided DVD-Rs can store 9.4GB.</p>.
      			<li>DVD-RW</li>
      			<p>DVD-RW stands for "Digital Versatile Disk Rewritable." A DVD-RW is like a DVD-R but can be erased and written to again. Like CD-RWs, DVD-RWs must be erased in order for new data to be added. DVD-RWs can hold 4.7GB of data and do not come in double-layered or double-sided versions like DVD-Rs do. Because of their large capacity and ability to be used mulitple times, DVD-RW discs are a great solution for frequent backups. To record data onto a DVD-RW disc, you'll need a DVD burner that supports the DVD-RW format.</p>
      			<li>DVD-ROM</li>
      			<p>Digital versatile disc-read only memory (DVD-ROM) is a read-only digital versatile disc (DVD) commonly used for storing large software applications. It is similar to a compact disk-read only memory (CD-ROM) but has a larger capacity. A DVD-ROM stores around 4.38 GB of data. A CD-ROM usually stores 650 MB of data.</p>
      			<p>A DVD-ROM permanently stores data files which cannot be changed, written over or erased. A personal computer (PC) with a DVD-ROM or a DVD-RAM drive is designed to read a DVD-ROM disc. Generally a DVD-ROM disc is not equipped to be used with a DVD drive connected to a home theater system or television. But many DVD-ROM drives can generally read a DVD movie disc.</p>

      			Fig: Blu-Ray Disk
      		</div>
      		<p>A Blu-ray disk (BD) is a high-capacity optical disk medium developed for recording, rewriting and playing back high definition video. It can store large amounts of data and was designed to supersede the DVD.</p>
      		<p>Blu-ray was jointly developed by a group of personal computer and consumer electronics companies called the Blu-ray Disc Association. Blu-ray disks support higher resolutions and more advanced video and audio formats compared to DVDs.</p>
