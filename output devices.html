	<h3>Monitor</h3>
	<p>Monitors, commonly called as <b>Visual Display Unit</b> (VDU), are the main output device of a computer. It forms images from tiny dots, called pixels that are arranged in a rectangular form. The sharpness of the image depends upon the number of pixels.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of viewing screen used for monitors.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Cathode-Ray Tube (CRT)</li>
<li>Flat-Panel Display</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Cathode-Ray Tube (CRT) Monitor</li>
<p>The CRT display is made up of small picture elements called pixels. The smaller the pixels, the better the image clarity or resolution. It takes more than one illuminated pixel to form a whole character, such as the letter ‘e’ in the word help.</p>
<div>

</div>
<p>A finite number of characters can be displayed on a screen at once. The screen can be divided into a series of character boxes - fixed location on the screen where a standard character can be placed. Most screens are capable of displaying 80 characters of data horizontally and 25 lines vertically.</p>
<p>There are some disadvantages of CRT.they are:-</p>
i.Large in Size<br>
ii.High power consumption
<li>Flat-Panel Display Monitor</li>
<p>The flat-panel display refers to a class of video devices that have reduced volume, weight and power requirement in comparison to the CRT. You can hang them on walls or wear them on your wrists. Current uses of flat-panel displays include calculators, video games, monitors, laptop computer, and graphics display.</p>
<div>

</div>
<p>The flat-panel display is divided into two categories.They are:-</p>
i.<b>Emissive Displays</b>:-Emissive displays are devices that convert electrical energy into light. For example, plasma panel and LED (Light-Emitting Diodes).<br>
ii.<b>Non-Emissive Displays</b>:-Non-emissive displays use optical effects to convert sunlight or light from some other source into graphics patterns. For example, LCD (Liquid-Crystal Device).

<h3>Speaker</h3>

</div>
<p>The multimedia system without speaker is incomplete. It amplifies sound output. A good pair of speakers connected to sound card will give you loads of listening pleasure. The audio output of the computer system relayed through the speakers. This enables audible alerts to be given to the user, as well as the playback of other sounds and music. More advanced speaker systems exist, allowing certain programs (such as music creation software and games) to use surround sound capabilities to beneficial effect.</p>

<h3>Printer</h3>
<p>A printer is an external hardware output device that takes the electronic data stored on a computer or other device and generates a hard copy of it. For example, if you created a report on your computer you could print several copies to hand out at a staff meeting. Printers are one of the most popular computer peripherals and are commonly used to print text and photos.</p>
<p>
	There are two types of printer.They are:<br>
	1.Impact printer<br>
	2.Non-impact printer
</p>
<ol>
	<li><b>Impact Printer</b></li>
	<p>An impact printer is a type of printer that works by direct contact of an ink ribbon with paper. A metal or plastic head strikes the ink ribbon, whereby the ribbon is pressed against the paper and the desired character (letter, digit, dot, line) impression is printed on the sheet.</p>
	<p>some impact printer are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Dot Matrix Printer</li>
		<div>
			<img src="dmp.jpg" height="300" width="350"><br>
				Fig: Dot Matrix Printer
		</div>
		<p>A dot matrix printer (DMP) is a type of printer which uses pins impacting an ink ribbon to print. These printers are generally considered outdated, as they cannot create high-quality prints and are costly as well. However, they have a certain specialty that other printers like inkjet and laser printers do not have: as they use impact for printing, they can be used to print multiple copies of text at the same time with the help of carbon copying. Therefore, they are mostly used in places where multipart forms are required.A dot matrix printer is also known as an impact matrix printer.</p>
		<li>Daisy Wheel Printer</li>
		<p>A daisy wheel printer is an early type of impact printer invented in 1969 by David S. Lee at Diablo Data Systems. The printer uses a metal or plastic disk containing each of the letters, numbers, and other characters it supports. When something is printed, the printer rotates the disk to each character and then using a hammer strike each character into an ink ribbon to create the character on paper.</p>
		<div>

		</div>
		<p>Daisy wheel printers were popular in the 1970s and 1980s, but are no longer used because of they have a low quality of print, are very slow, loud, and laser printers have come down in cost.</p>
		<li>Line Printer</li>
		<div>
			<img src="line printer.jpg"><br>
			Fig: Line Printer
		</div>
		<p>A line printer is an impact printer which makes use of a continuous feed of paper and prints one line of text at a time. Although they have been replaced in most instances by high-speed laser printers, they are still used in some business as they are low cost and have the ability to print on multi-part forms.A line printer is also known as a bar printer.</p>
		</ul>
	<li>Non Impact Printer</li>
	<p>A Non Impat Printer ia printer that prints without banging a ribbon onto paper. Non-impact printers do not use a striking device to produce characters on the paper; and because these printers do not hammer against the paper they are much quieter.</p>
	<p>Following are some non-impacted printers:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Inkjet Printer</li>
		<div>
			<img src="inkjet printer.jpg"><br>
			Fig: Inject Printer
		</div>
			<p>An inkjet printer is a computer peripheral that produces hard copy by spraying ink onto paper. A typical inkjet printer can produce copy with a resolution of at least 300 dots per inch ( dpi ). Some inkjet printers can make full color hard copies at 600 dpi or more. Many models include other devices such as a scanner , photocopier , and dedicated fax machine along with the printer in a single box.</p>
		<li>Laser Printer</li>
		<div>
			<img src="laser printer.jpg" height="300" width="350">
			<br>Fig: Laser Printer
		</div>
		<p>A laser printer is a popular type of personal computer printer that uses a non-impact (keys don't strike the paper), photocopier technology. When a document is sent to the printer, a laser beam "draws" the document on a selenium-coated drum using electrical charges. After the drum is charged, it is rolled in toner, a dry powder type of ink. The toner adheres to the charged image on the drum. The toner is transferred onto a piece of paper and fused to the paper with heat and pressure. After the document is printed, the electrical charge is removed from the drum and the excess toner is collected. Most laser printers print only in monochrome. A color laser printer is up to 10 times more expensive than a monochrome laser printer.</p>
		<li>Thermal Printer</li>
		<p>A thermal printer is a printer that makes use of heat in order to produce the image on paper. </p>
		<div>
			<img src="thermal printer.jpg" height="300" width="350""><br>
			Fig: Laser Printer
		</div>
		<p>Due to quality of print, speed, and technological advances it has become increasingly popular and is mostly used in airline, banking, entertainment, retail, grocery, and healthcare industries. Thermal printing does not make use of ink or toner unlike many other printing forms but largely depends on thermal papers for producing the images.They are also quiet popular in creating labels owing to speed of printing.</p>
	</ul>
</ol>

<aside id="plotter">
	<h3>Plotter</h3>
	<div>
		<img src="plotter.jpg"><br>
		Fig: Plotter
	</div>
	<p>A plotter is a computer hardware device much like a printer that is used for printing vector graphics. Instead of toner, plotters use a pen, pencil, marker, or another writing tool to draw multiple, continuous lines onto paper rather than a series of dots like a traditional printer. Though once widely used for computer-aided design, these devices have more or less been phased out by wide-format printers. Plotters are used to produce a hard copy of schematics and other similar applications.</p>
