	<p>A computer system is a basic, complete and functional computer, including all the hardware and software required to make it functional for a user.<p>

	<p>It should have the ability to receive user input, process data, and with the processed data, create information for storage and/or output.</p>
	<p>A computer system allows users to input, manipulate and store data. Computer systems typically include a computer, monitor, keyboard, mouse and other optional components. All of these components also can be integrated into all-in-one units, such as laptop computers.</p>

	<p>During the data processing stage, instruction sets, known as programs, are provided to let the system know what to do with the entered system data. Without these programs, the computer would not know how to process data that enters the system, and the data might be discarded. Known as a stored program computer, this type of computer is the most common in use today. It is very flexible, as it can process any task by loading a program from storage. Computer systems can work by themselves or access other devices that are external or connected with other computer systems.</p>
