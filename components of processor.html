	<h3>Components Of Processor</h3>
	A microprocessor consists of four major functional components such as:
	<div><b>1.Input unit</b></div>
			<p>The input unit of the computer system is used for feeding data and instructions to the computer. These data and instructions given to the computer are called as input and the devices used for giving input are called input unit or devices.
A computer consists of an I/O system. It is used by a person to communicate with a computer. For instance, a keyboard or a mouse may be an input device for a computer, while monitors and printers are considered output devices for a computer.
In computer architecture, the combination of the CPU and main memory is considered the brain of a computer, and from that point of view any transfer of information from or to that combination is considered I/O.
</p>
<p>
Hence, the devices that are used to input data to the computer are called input unit or devices. The input devices of computer are keyboard, mouse, MICR, OCR, scanner, joystick, trackball etc.
</p>
			
<div><b>2.Central processing unit(CPU)</b></div>
<p>The main unit inside the computer is the CPU. This unit is responsible for all events inside the computer. It controls all internal and external devices, performs Arithmetic and Logical operations. The operations a Microprocessor performs are called "instruction set" of this processor. The instruction set is “hard wired” in the CPU and determines the machine language for the CPU. The more complicated the instruction set is, the slower the CPU works. Processors differed from one another by the instruction set. If the same program can run on two different computer brands they are said to be compatible. Programs written for IBM compatible computers will not run on Apple computers because these two architectures are not compatible.</p>
<p>The control Unit and the Arithmetic and Logic unit of a computer system are jointly known as the Central Processing Unit (CPU). The CPU is the brain of any computer system. In a human body, all major decisions are taken by the brain and the other parts of the body function as directed by the brain. Similarly, in a computer system, all major calculations and comparisons are made inside the CPU and the CPU is also responsible for activating and controlling the operations of other units of a computer system</p>

<div><b>3.Output unit</b></div>
<p>The job of an output unit is just the reverse of that of an input unit. It supplied information and results of computation to the outside world. Thus it links the computer with the external environment. As computers work with binary code, the results produced are also in the binary form. Hence, before supplying the results to the outside world, it must be converted to human acceptable (readable) form. This task is accomplished by units called output interfaces.</p>
<p>In short, the following functions are performed by an output unit.</p>
<ul>
<li>It accepts the results produced by the computer which are in coded form and hence cannot be easily understood by us.</li>
<li>It converts these coded results to human acceptable (readable) form.</li>
<li>It supplied the converted results to the outside world.</li>
</ul>
<div><b>4.Memory unit</b></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: lucida sans unicode,lucida grande,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 16px;">The data and instructions that are entered into the computer system through input units have to be stored inside the computer before the actual processing starts. Similarly, the results produced by the computer after processing must also be kept somewhere inside the computer system before being passed on to the output units. Moreover, the intermediate results produced by the computer must also be preserved for ongoing processing. The <strong>Storage Unit</strong> or the <strong>primary / main storage</strong> of a computer system is designed to do all these things. It provides space for storing data and instructions, space for intermediate results and also space for the final results.</p>
<p >In short, the specific functions of the storage unit are to store:</p>
<ul>
<li>All the data to be processed and the instruction required for processing (received from input devices).</li>
<li>Intermediate results of processing.</li>
<li>Final results of processing before these results are released to an output device.</li>
</ul>
