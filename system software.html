	<h2>System Software</h2>
	<p>System software is software on a computer that is designed to control and work with computer hardware. The two main types of system software are the operating system and the software installed with the operating system, often called utility software. The operating system and utility software typically depend on each other to function properly.</p>
	<p>Some system software is used directly by users and other system software works in the background. System software can allow users to interact directly with hardware functionality, like the Device Manager and many of the utilities found in the Control Panel.</p>
	<h1>System software can be classified as:-</h1>
	<p>1.Operating System<br>
	2.Drive Drvers<br>
	3.Unity Software</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Operating System</li>
		<p>An operating system (OS) is the program that, after being initially loaded into the computer by a boot program, manages all the other programs in a computer. The other programs are called applications or application programs. The application programs make use of the operating system by making requests for services through a defined application program interface (API). In addition, users can interact directly with the operating system through a user interface such as a command line or a graphical user interface (GUI).</p>
		<li>Language Processor(Translator)</li>
		<p>The programs which translate the program written in a programming language by the user into an executable program is known as language processors. The program translated by language processor is understood by the hardware of the computer. Examples of language processor are assemblers, compilers and interpreters.</p>
		<p><b>Compilers</b>:-A compiler is a program which translates a program written in a high level language into machine language program that can be understood by the computer. Generally, compilers are large programs that occupy a large memory space.</p>
		<p><b>Assemblers</b>:-An assembler translates from a low level language to binary machine code. The assembler produces one machine instruction for each source instruction . The assemblers are generally used in assembling the source code or program code written in assembly language .</p>
		<p><b>Interpreter</b>:-Interpreter is a program which translates the statement ofâ€™ a high level language into machine codes. It translates one statement at a time. lt seems to be similar to a compiler, but a compiler reads the entire program first and then translates it into machine codes. Hence, assemblers, compilers and interpreter all of them are computer programs.</p>
		</p>
		<li>Unity Software</li>
		<p>Utility software is system software designed to help to analyze, configure, optimize or maintain a computer.[1] It is used to support the computer infrastructure - in contrast to application software, which is aimed at directly performing tasks that benefit ordinary users. Utilities often form part of application systems however. For example a batch job may run user-written code to update a database and may then include a step that runs a utility to back up the database, or a job may run a utility to compress a disk before copying files.</p>
		<p>Although a basic set of utility programs is usually distributed with an operating system (OS), and utility software is considered part of the operating system, users often install replacements or additional utilities.[citation needed] Those utilities may provide additional facilities to carry out tasks that are beyond the capabilities of the operating system.</p>
